The following features are supported:

- Loading `.har` files from file or url
- Filter entries on Method, Status Code, Domain and Resource Type
- Sort entries by Status Code and Timing
- Group entries by Method, Status Code, Status Type, Domain and Resource Type
- Offline usage (PWA)
- Usable UI on mobile devices

## Usage

1. Visit [https://develerik.github.io/har-viewer](https://develerik.github.io/har-viewer)
2. Open a `.har` file
  - Option 1: Open a file from your local device
  - Option 2: Open a file from a remote url
3. Analyze your file

## Roadmap

- Export Feature (filters, redact, postman)
